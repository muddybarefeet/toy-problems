// Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of 
//the given numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in 
//evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one 
//that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.

// ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes of 
//the elements start from 1 (not 0)
